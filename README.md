Built as a gift for my partner and friend Charles Lloyd who more than anyone on earth knows the value of such a network, with nothing more than a splash page and a toolbar, for he alone would know the value of fixing the fundamental problems inherent within the industry we together have had a monopoly on.

Brainstorming the likely startups beginning with simple apps made possible by new technology, the ease with which people are impressed and willing to fund has resulted in a short list of 50 low cost fundable startups that an be launched immediately with a small crew managed in person internationally by Ray. From Federated Identity Proxies, to Cloud IDE's, to Emoji oriented domain search and registrars, to hands-free voice-free device EEG Brain Driven UX (yes, drive or move a cursor by thinking), Cloud PBX with call recording and transcription and sentiment analyses, Voice Secured account access, WebRTC Conferencing, Banner Design templating and storage with recommendation and specs  for IAB, (much of which has already been done), solves 3rd party credibility in that as an incubator for throwing as many at the wall until happy with the stick count, each one ini its own rate as a failure even would be 1000x more real and more powerful as credibility than anything done before. Thus if I'm at all wrong about the viability of the market in any of those cases, we still win because such trash would be a treasure trove of credibility for to the keywords platform. And very real. As it happens, down to the name (adPush), and exact same open-source (codeanywhere, nitrous.io slapping a logo on cloud9), (cloudyvbx and 5 others using openvbx fully licensed for reuse which by others were sold for $50 million to cisco the same year, or the broadsoft 1.9 billion, etc.) as opposed to past attempts to find time to make a supporting page, or relying on client reference is replaced by tremendous opportunity. 

To be an incubator for startups, a gift for Eric Schmidt to solve 3 of his biggest challenges and maximize the revenue of what would inevitably be the #1 product of the 2nd largest corporation in the world (as of 2016 iframe ads are a standard offering I was right ah-ahem...) Also built to free humanity from the telecom industry, esp Mexico, and to reunite all stars from previous incarnations from Russia, to Tucson,  Orange County.

Patent unfinished credited to Charles, Levan, Osama, and Ray. The symmetry of the organizational structure is the closest to perfect, most efficient thing I have ever conceived, it was the closest thing to perfection all my years of success and many disappointments, have taught me. It was devised at the peak of my powers and destroyed by the cynicism of my terrible friends and so-called partners.

Server records show coding began as early as 2007 for the basic concept and 2008 for the video. Draft status with many W3C and other standards groups working on WebRTC, ORTC, CSS3, WebSockets, HTML5, etc. On hiatus until 2013 core components demo-ready 2014, h264 open oct 2014 thanks to Mozilla, patents started but unfiled and offices lost for lack of resources even a few hundred dollars in 2015 because those I did it for did not believe a word I said. Now down to the pixel, a striped down version is the hottest sensation in marketing and worth tens of billions. I didn't predict it because I'm psychic I forecasted what was obvious and inevitable and built a way to leverage the inevitability to take full advantage.

Nicknamed project X / K-4G ("Keywords are Back") was built simultaneous to K-3G which (Protectional Extensions) was only ever to be a draft bare-bones network of retooled spare parts to keep opportunities open withh Sam and others before a bullet proof and proper unveiling could take place requiring participants to not be busy talking behind my back and tanking every revenue stream I have while breaking my back to build this for us.
